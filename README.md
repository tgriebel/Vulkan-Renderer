# Extensa: Vulkan-Renderer

Calling this "Extensa" after Descartes Res Extensa--"a thing extended in space". I've always conceived of 3D rendering as giving shape to abstract logical worlds so felt the name fit.

Work-in-progress. Some parts are rough yet, but it's taking shape. The Gfx-Core repo is essential for repo.

* Shadow maps
* PBR Opaque
* Transparents

* Stencil effects
